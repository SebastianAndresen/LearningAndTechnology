        <p>The objective for this tutorial is to develop an easy-to-understand tutorial for teachers on how to effectively conduct online teaching with a step-by-step guide on what to have in mind when teaching online and designing e-learning solutions. Throughout the tutorial, the teachers will test their knowledge on small tasks developed using h5p.org - a html based tool that allows interactive online teaching.</p>
        <p>The video is developed through multiple iterations beginning with a storyboard, then the first video version, then the second, with an evaluation in between each iteration.</p>
